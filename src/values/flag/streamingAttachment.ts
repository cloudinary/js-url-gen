 *  However, if the video transformation is being requested for the first time, this flag causes the video download
 * to begin immediately, streaming it as a fragmented video file.
 *
 * In contrast, if the regular fl_attachment flag is used when a user requests a new video transformation,
 * the download will begin only after the complete transformed video has been generated.
 *
 * Most standard video players successfully play fragmented video files without issue.
