```javascript
// Import the cloudinary class
import {Cloudinary} from "@cloudinary/url-gen/instance/Cloudinary";

// Create your instance
const cld = new Cloudinary({
    cloud: {
        cloudName: 'demo'
    },
    url: {
        secure: true // force https, set to false to force http
    }
});

// Lets create a new image
const myImage = cld.image('sample');

// The image interface exposes a lot of useful functions we call ActionGroups
// Each ActionGroup accepts a matching Action as a parameter

// For example, resize is an ActionGroup that needs a ResizeAction to work
// There are many types of Resizes, so we'll need to be specific.
// This doesn't make much sense on its own
// myImage.resize();


// the resize() ActionGroup needs an Action parameter
// Lets give resize() a ResizeScale paramter to scale our image
// We import all of our Action parameters from @cloudinary/url-gen/actions/{actionGroup}
// Note that you can import all Resize Actions, or just the single one you want
import {Resize} from "@cloudinary/url-gen/actions/resize";
const {scale} = Resize;
// Resize.scale === scale
// Explore the Resize object to discover more resize actions

// The Actions are actually factory functions that return an Action Object
// Every Action has a different set of methods (for scale, we have width and height)
myImage.resize(Resize.scale().width(100).height(100));

// When we're done, we can apply all our changes and create a URL.
const myURL = myImage.toURL();
// https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_scale,w_100,h_100/sample
```
